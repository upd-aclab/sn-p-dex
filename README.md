# `sn-p-dex`

The Pok√©dex for Spiking Neural P (SN P) systems!

As part of my research apprenticeship at the Algorithms and Complexity lab, I'm developing a website that collates known information and results on the different kinds of SN P systems out there.

The aim of this website is to assist SN P researchers: by having a unified collection, scouring around for data will become seamless. The locality of information may also incite new ideas or research directions!
